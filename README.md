# OurPeople Tech Test (QA)

This is a very simple single page application built with React. The app has two pages, the first page contains a list of people and the second contains a view of a single person.

There is support for sorting the list of people as well as deleting individuals. State is only preserved during the app's lifetime and is not persisted.

## Task

We would like for you to:

1. Manually QA the application and report your findings.
2. With any remaining time, create an automated test suite and add automated tests.

You do not have to complete the whole task - you don't need to spend more than two hours on this as we don't want to use up too much of your time on a throw away application. If you do run out of time or can't spare that much time, instead note how long you spent, any sticking points and what you would have done given more time. Likewise, if you do spend more time than mentioned, then please mention how long and your reasons for continuing.

Once you're done, you can upload source files and send them (or a link to them) and a summary of your experience to us via your recruiter.

## Available commands

### `docker-compose up`

Will start the Docker container and run the app in development mode.

You can then view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm start`

If not using Docker this allows you to run the app on your host machine.
